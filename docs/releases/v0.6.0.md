## v0.6.0

**Released:** 30/08/2019

Welcome to the `v0.6.0` release, consisting of major underlying improvements, and a more efficient runtime.

This release consists of **25** noteworthy PRs from 4 contributors; although v0.5.0 was released just two weeks ago!
We had **5** contributions from 2 external contributors, thanks!

The main themes of this release has been:

- **containerd** is now used as the default container runtime for higher security and speed, and less resource usage
  - This means that Ignite doesn't depend on `docker` anymore!
- **CNI** is now the default networking plugin; by default the `bridge` and `portmap` plugins are used
  - You can still use your third-party CNI implementation of choice, see [the networking doc](https://ignite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/networking.html)
- **GitOps Toolkit** refactor is complete; now everything you need to create your Git-backed application is available at **https://github.com/weaveworks/gitops-toolkit**
  - Ignite is using this toolkit internally to perform its GitOps capabilities, now you can easily use this functionality, too!
- **Bugfixes and usability improvements** all around the place

Also, our documentation is now available at **https://ignite.readthedocs.org**.
